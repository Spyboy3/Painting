So , I created a paint like clone wsing c and the sdl2 library . It was a fun experience , the sdl wiki helped me a lot for documentation and understanding the use of the sdl functions and data types. 
I also required to go through some geometry formulas in order to change the shape of the color filling shape from rectangle to circle .
Also i used a delay function for cpu usage optimisation .
